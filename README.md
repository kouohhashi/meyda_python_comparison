But mfcc data I get from Meyda.js is quite different from the mfcc data I get from python_speech_features maybe because I use default setting for Meyda.js and I don't know much about audio signal processing.

I hope some give me hint to get mfcc similar enough to python_speech_features to do deep learning inference which the model we train with Python.

You need to install some libralies to run python server.
